\section{Introduction}
The development of generative Machine Learning models made huge steps forward in the last years, considering the comparison with human crafted artefacts. Large Language Models (LLM) enable the generation of texts in all kinds of different flavours and styles. Image generating models like Vision Transformer (ViT) already created fake images being reported as real by media. Other news showed artists winning art competitions with generated art. This creates an interest in detecting which texts or images are AI generated and which ones are real images or human-written texts.

Therefore researchers evaluated different approaches to detect fake images and texts. Some adversarial attacks are already known to be able to reduce the performance of other computer vision tasks, e. g. visual object detection, by artificially manipulating real images. This raises the questions, whether and how it is possible to manipulate generated artefacts (e.g. images and texts) to reduce the accuracy of detectors.


It is necessary to evaluate whether such techniques exist, because otherwise one could rely on detectors, which can easily be tricked. If easy efficient manipulation techniques exist, detectors need to be improved or better detectors need to be developed that are robust against these techniques. But this requires a good understanding how the attacks are performed.

Therefore we came up with the following research questions:


RQ1: How can generated images be manipulated to trick fake image detectors?


RQ2: How can generated texts be manipulated to trick fake text generators?


The report is structured as follows: After this introduction chapter 2 presents related work, especially text and image generating models as well as fake image and text detectors. Chapter 3 presents the methodology of our work followed by chapter 4 presenting the results of our experiments. Afterwards the results will be discussed in chapter 5 and chapter 6 will conclude this paper.

\subsection{Generating models}

\subsubsection{Image generating models}
As a second image generative model we use Dall-E from OpenaAI (\url{https://openai.com/dall-e-3}). Dall-E works by modelling text and image tokens as a single data stream. This is achieved by training a transformer to autoregressively model those tokens into the resulting stream.

This is done in two steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The images get compressed in a $32 \times 32$ grid of image tokens to reduce the context size of the transformer.
	\item BPE-encoded text tokens are concatenated with the image tokens to model a joint distribution over text and image tokens with the training of an autoregressive transformer.
\end{enumerate}

The exact procedure proposed by Ramesh et. al is explained in their paper. \cite{ramesh2021zeroshot}

\subsubsection{Text generating models}

\subsection{Detector models}

\subsubsection{Image detector models}


The \textbf{AIorNot} detector by Nahrawy on Hugging Face is a pretrained swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224 fine-tuned on the AI or Not dataset. Swin-Transformer by Microsoft is a new Vision Transformer which makes use of hierarchical windows. This reduces the self-attention to not-overlapping windows of other areas of the image \cite{liu2021swin}.

The \textbf{ai-image-det-resnet18} model is a community made, fine-tuned, resnet18 based, pretrained image detection model. For fine-tuning the author kgmann on Hugging Face used the AI or Not dataset. ResNet-18 is a convolutional neural network that is 18 layers deep. It got pretrained by over a million images from the ImageNet database. \cite{he2015deep}


\subsubsection{Text detector models}

The \textbf{RoBERTa Base OpenAI Detector} is the output detector model of GPT-2. It was obtained by fine-tuning a RoBERTa base model with the outputs of the GPT-2 model containing 1,5 Billion parameters. The RoBERTa Base OpenAI Detector can be used to classify texts, on whether they are likely to be created by the GPT-2 model. It was published by OpenAI, when the weights of the GPT-2 model 1,5 Billion parameter version was released.

The \textbf{RADAR-Vicuna-7B} text detector is an adversarial-learning trained model introduced by TrustSafeAI. In the training stage a detector tried to differentiate between human and AI text while a paraphraser trained to make the text more human.
The AI-generated text for learning is extracted by the LLM Vicuna-7B-v1.1 written by LMSYS Org \cite{hu2023radar}.


\section{Method}
To test and evaluate the effect of different data augmentation techniques on the detection capabilities of fake image or text detectors, we created a pipeline of three components: The first component is a generator, which is a model capable of generating fake images or texts. The second component is a processor which augments the data through a specified method, after given a generated image or text. The last component is a detector, which suggests an input being either real or fake. This way we can compare it to the ground truth, to evaluate the capabilities of the detector. By comparing the results with augmented artefacts and with the generated ones without augmentation, we can evaluate the effectiveness of different AI detector-tricking techniques.
