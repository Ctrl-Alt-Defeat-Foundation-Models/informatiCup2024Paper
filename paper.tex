% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

The \textbf{RoBERTa Base OpenAI Detector} is the output detector model of GPT-2. It was obtained by fine-tuning a RoBERTa base model with the outputs of the GPT-2 model containing 1,5 Billion parameters. The RoBERTa Base OpenAI Detector can be used to classify texts, on whether they are likely to be created by the GPT-2 model. It was published by OpenAI, when the weights of the GPT-2 model 1,5 Billion parameter version was released.
